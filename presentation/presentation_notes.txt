Slide 1:
Intro:
Hi, my name is Hannah, and today I’ll be presenting my capstone project: Data Dwellers

The idea for this project came from my desire for a change of scenery

I’ve lived in Nashville and the Middle Tennessee area for most of my life, and I’m ready to explore somewhere new

Slide 2:

So I thought, why not use the skills I’ve learned in this class to help guide the decision of where should I live.......

Slide 3:

To help me determine which cities I should compare I had these factors in mind:

I wanted to look at the Diversity of each city. As a diverse city offers a wide range of restaurants, has a variety cultural events, and fosters a vibrant, and inclusive community.

While I am a remote worker and don’t have to travel into a office - I wanted a city that had public transportation as an option

The most boring but most important factor I needed to look at is cost of living

To determine which cities to compare I wanted to look at cities that aligned with my astrological chart. 
While I don’t take astrology too seriously I wanted to ensure that the cities I was looking at would lead to a successful life

I also know that out of all the places I have traveled to in the US, I have not really found a place that felt like home to me. So I want to look at cities I have not visited yet.


Slide 4

I decided to use my astrological chart and Astro cartography to find U.S. cities that positivity aligned with my planetary influences. 

Astro cartography or astrology can guide you toward cities that energetically support your growth — and data can confirm they meet your needs.

The lines on my chart crossed cities like Asheville, Santa Fe, Seattle, Portland, and Boston.

From there, I narrowed the list using the factors I mentioned earlier.
I removed Asheville and Boston because I’ve already visited them.

I ruled out Portland as I did not feel “weird” enough to live there (and yes, I realize I’m saying that while showing you my astrological chart).
And Santa Fe unfortunately lacked the detailed city data I needed for this project.

After selecting these cities I used data analysis to ensure they aligned with my personal and professional growth.
That leaves us with the final four cities we’ll be exploring today…



Slide 5:

Raleigh, Seattle, Austin and Philadelphia.
For these four cities we are going to look at the social demographic, public transit, and what it costs to live in each.

Lets looks at the first factor..



Slide 6:



Social demographics or the diversity of each city.

This factor is important to me because, a city with diversity has a variety of restaurants, different cultural events, and a strong community.



Slide 7:

Here we are looking at the regional origins of the foreign-born population in each city.

Seattle and Raleigh have the highest percentages of residents born in Asia, while Austin has the largest Latin American-born population.

According to America’s Most Diverse Food Cities, Seattle ranks #3, Philadelphia #11, and Austin #15.

So Why does this matters to me:

Living in a diverse city isn’t just about access to great restaurants
diversity brings a mix of cultures, leads to different ideas, habits and lifestyles. 



The next factor we are going to look at is transportation…

Slide 8:


While I am a remote worker and do not necessarily need to travel daily into an office, I would like to live somewhere that has an option for public transportation…

To evaluate the transit systems of these cities, I examined how much each city spends and the population density within their service areas.



Slide 9:
Here we have the percentage of each city's budget that is allocated to public transportation. 

It's important to note that this figure may be misleading, as the total operating budgets vary between cities.

Next we will look at how much each cities transit budget is


Slide 10:
Here we have how much each city budgets for transportation.

Through my analysis of each cities budget, the transportation budgets appear to include not only public transit, but also infrastructure such as sidewalks, traffic lights, and road maintenance

All these factors can influence the effectiveness of public transportation.

Now let’s look at the service area population density



Slide 11:

Here is city budget per person. This is how much each city spends per person on public transportation.


Now let’s look at the service area population density

Slide 12:

Here, we’re looking at how many people live per square mile within each city's public transportation service area.
This data shows not only the size of the service area but also how densely populated it is.

Higher density usually means:

Greater demand for transit
Potentially more efficient or cost-effective operations
More frequent service or infrastructure investment

Lower density might suggest:

A more spread-out city layout
Greater reliance on personal vehicles
Higher costs to serve fewer people


While not shown here, Seattle stands out as having one of the most diverse transportation systems among the cities I studied. The city offers buses, light rail, streetcars, regional rail, ferries, and even a monorail.

It’s also worth noting that from Philadelphia, you can take a train to major cities like New York City, Washington, D.C., and Boston.

Now let’s look at the next factor

Slide 13:

cost of living…

Are these cities going to be in the budget or do I need to ask for a raise????


Slide 14:

First we are going to look at the per capita personal consumption expenditures by state. This is the average amount of money each person spends on goods and services annually 

This is based on data from 2023.

This includes housing /utilities, Healthcare, dining out, and other personal consumption expenditures.

For scale the united state average is $56,202

Next we will break these down into three core categories...


Slide 15:

This chart highlights three core cost-of-living categories: housing and utilities, healthcare, and dining out.

Among the cities compared, Pennsylvania stands out for having the highest healthcare costs, whereas Washington leads in housing expenses.

Next we will break down monthly utility cost..


Slide 16:

Here we have the average monthly water and electric bill for each state.

While Washington ranked high in previous categories, its electric costs are lower. This is largely because over half of Washington’s electricity comes from hydropower.

Electric costs can also vary by climate. For example, warmer states often see higher bills due to increased air conditioning use—this could explain why Austin has a higher-than-average electric bill.

North Carolina’s water bills are significantly lower, likely due to the state's Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ), which developed a Water Efficiency Best Management Practices (BMP) manual for community water systems.

Now let’s look at housing cost…


Slide 17:

Here we have the average cost of rent for a single-family home from 2015 to 2024
Seattle ranks the highest, which aligns with trends seen in previous charts.
Austin is in the middle
While Raleigh and Philadelphia have remained relatively stable and close in price over this period.

Next, we'll take a look at the average home prices in these cities.


Slide 18:
Here we have the average single-family home prices from 2015 to 2024.

Seattle remains the most expensive, with the average home price exceeding $900k

Austin remains in the middle w/ Raleigh

and Philadelphia is more affordable than Raleigh, 

with a lower average home price over this period.


Slide 19:

After taking these factors into consideration… Where should I live?

Slide 20:

Philadelphia stands out as a top contender with its combination of affordability, diverse population, and strong transportation options. 

Its housing costs are lower than many comparable cities, it also offers a robust public transit system that connects easily to major hubs like New York City, Washington, D.C., and Boston.

In addition to practical advantages, Philadelphia has a vibrant restaurant scene and rich cultural diversity, making it a more appealing choose. 

Seattle offers a wide range of transportation options and plenty of green spaces but comes with a significantly higher cost of living.

Raleigh shares similar diversity and green space benefits but lacks Philadelphia’s extensive transit network.

Overall, Philadelphia’s balance of affordability, connectivity, and lifestyle amenities positions it as the best choice.

With this research in mind.....

Slide 21:

My next step is to explore these cities up close.


 Here’s my plan for visiting each one.
